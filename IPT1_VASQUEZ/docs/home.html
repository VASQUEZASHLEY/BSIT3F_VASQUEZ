            I'm a hands-on moderator who actively promotes open communication, encourages collaboration, and 
            organizes engaging events. By upholding rules fairly and resolving conflicts promptly, I strive to create a 
            thriving and supportive community.<br><br>
            
            I'm a beginner artist who's fallen head over heels for sketching anime characters. It's a journey of 
            learning and exploration, and I'm loving every step of it. My art is my passion, and I'm always eager to improve and 
            share my progress.
